# Bankist App
A front-end app that uses DOM Manipulation to manipulate the html elements on-screen
Has a simple login feature where the data does not persist when page is refreshed
## Description
The styles and html file were not created by me, so the script.js was my main focus. I am trying to add more things to this to make look better and more functional. I use DOM manipulation and the document object to manipulate the html elements on screen. I attach event listeners to buttons, so when I login I change the styles of various elements and add few transitions affects.

## Extra features to add
I want to add some extra features to this app to make it look a little better and so that I'm implementing most of the features in the end 
* Add a modal when the user that was deleted tries to login (say something like 'account does not exist')
* change the login screen and center it in the middle of the page
* Eventually connect it to a database and persist the data using a backend server
```like express.js```
